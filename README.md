What is a word cloud and how it can help you in making your story more attractive?

Word cloud is a specific way of presenting text. The more frequently you use the word, the bigger it is on the picture. This kind of presentation has been used in internet on blog sites or on www sites where the frequency of exact word is presented. Nowadays such usage is no longer so popular. Look for the example of such word cloud:
 
Colors used in this kind of graphs do not play any role as the main assumption is to present it in an elegant way. Anyway there is a simple trick that we can add to this graph. We can add  so called „mask”, which is a shape of background. As a result you could improve your presentations and make your audience more engaged with such interesting form of displaying text information.
Below as an example I used the lyrics of Beyonce from the „Dangerously in Love” record using the word cloud on two types of masks.
  
I hope you like the idea of presenting your data on your company logo.
Please be advised that such graphs have one major imperfection - they are not very precise, as they have more visual effect and we use them as they look elegant and transparent for the audience.
Anyway I am sure that word clouds may enrich your story which you are going to tell as well as increase concentration on your presentations.

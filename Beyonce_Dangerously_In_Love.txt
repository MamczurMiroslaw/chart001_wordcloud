"Crazy In Love"
(feat. Jay-Z)


Yes! It's so crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B,
It's your boy, young.


You ready?
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no


Yeah, history in the making,
Part 2, it's so crazy right now


I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two three times in a row,

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Your touch got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,

It's the way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch (you're in love) got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

I'm looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy your love.

[Jay-Z (Beyonce):]
I'm on that now, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,
Young B and the R-O-C
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only,
Stick bony,
But the pocket is fat like Tony,
Soprano the ROC handle like Van Exel,
I shake phonies man, you can't get next to,
The genuine article I do not sing though,
I sling though, if anything I bling yo,

Star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy bring your whole set,
Jay-Z in the range,
Crazy and deranged,
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla.
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I've been iller than chain smokers,
How you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over,
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since I made the change over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
To platinum the game's been a wrap, one!


Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
'Cause baby you got me, you got me so crazy baby

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's (oh love) got me looking so crazy right now (lookin' crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss (baby) got me hoping you'll save me right now (baby)
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Your love got me looking so crazy right now,

"Hip Hop Star"
(feat. Big Boi & Sleepy Brown)

[Intro (Big Boi)]
Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town’s up, deuces down it’s the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I’m your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something

Ain’t no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I’m a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It’s the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

Are you infatuated with me
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move

I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I kick it tight

I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get messy?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bamboos on pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Undress me, undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them dripping down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!

A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in ‘em, let me P pop that thang

First check her brain to see if she’s sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man!

[Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel oh girl I know its bout to be.....
Me all on you and damn girl you all over me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

"Be With You"

Ooh baby
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing i won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when i'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothin
Saving it all for you
Baby i love making love to you
It's like a high i can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you oh yea
Boy i rather be with you
I'd rather be with you oh yea
Boy i rather be with you 

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I don't want nobody else
I ain't goin no where
I'm happy with you
You got me baby
I ain't thinking about
Nobody else but you baby

"Me, Myself & I"

All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out

I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
Took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

So controlling, you say that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

(I got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Still, I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again!

(Now I got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Still, I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again yeah!

(I got me, myself and I)
Me, myself and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Now, I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again!

(Now, I got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times, ladies you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Still, I'm about to make it through)
I can see the sun shine, I got me, myself, and I

"Yes"

I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time i said no
Its like I never said yes

I said yes we can be together
Yes you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin so ungratefully
The first time I said no

You was on the wall

You was watching me baby

Slowly you walked over 
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you

You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You some how intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye
I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night
So i gave my number to you

I said yes to your number
And yes to you dating me
Yes we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I said no
Its like I never said yes

I said yes we can be together 
Yes you can stay with me

Certainly you can call me baby
I love to here from you
Yes of course you can come and see me boy
I wanna get to know you more
Sure I'm feeling you
No baby, not yet
We can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset, boy you
Act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful
ummm ummm ummm

You was at my house 
I was sitting on the couch
You was really buggin
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve, you
Too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move to slow
I showed you to the door
You said you call me later
I said don't call no more
Its cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
Cuz you showed me your true face baby
The first time I said no

"That's How You Like It"
(feat. Jay-Z)

That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How I Like It, baby

I need a thug that’ll have my back
Do-rag, Nike Airs to match
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that
That’s how I like it, baby
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Timberland boots, you does that, it’s a fact
That’s how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain’t
I like your honesty, integrity,
It levels me, so please don’t ever change

That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How I Like It, baby

I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
It’s just the real things you do
That’s why I wanna stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love that
Sexy way they does that (you did that)
That’s how I like it, baby

I hope you like my style

I know you’ve heard I’m a gangsta
They say “Stay away from them gangstaz”
They never change up, or pull they pants up,
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don’t let‘em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt wrong before
This can’t be what it feel like
And they don’t really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don’t know the difference between real life
And the music videos & the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain’t mad at you, it’s just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That’s why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hovah & the Letter B
How you like that, huh?

That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How You Like It, huh
That’s How I Like It, baby

"Closer I Get To You"
(feat. Luther Vandross)

The closer i get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you got (tell me more)
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside , i knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more (more and more)
Let's give love a try

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way

Come a little closer so that we can see
Into the eyes of love

Cuz i wanna tell you something
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel a bout each other's loving

"Dangerously In Love 2"

I love you... I love you... I love you

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am a seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and mixed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
Sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful to have you by my side

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

'Cause I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love
To hold
To feel
To breathe
To live you

Dangerously in love
I can't do this thing
I love you, I love you, I love you
I'll never leave
Just keep loving me
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I cannot do
I cannot do anything without you in my life
Holding me, kissing me, loving me
Dangerously
I love you
Dangerously in love with you
I love you
Oh I love you
I love love love love love you
I love you
Oh I love you
I love love love love love you
I love you I love you I love you
Dangerously in love


"Beyonce Interlude"

[talking]
I believe that harmonies are colors

Every time I paint it sharpens my harmony
Yesterday I tried to paint you 

But the colors weren't beautiful enough

Your love goes beyond what I can say

Love,
Beyonce

"Gift From Virgo"

I wish i could look in your eyes
And tell you how i feel 
Right now inside
Baby i know that it's real
So real so real, so real
How i wish i could be with you
How i wish i wish i wish i could be with you right now

Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you
From your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

Do you remember our first kiss
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time 
We spent those weeks together
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say good-bye
I never want to say good-bye
I never ever want to say good-bye

One day we'll make love
Finally i'll be yours
Only you only you 
I could love you
It's too late 
I already love you
I love you 
I love you
I love you

"'03 Bonnie & Clyde"
(feat. Jay-Z)

[Talking]
Uhh uhh uhh.
You ready B? Let's go get 'em..

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin down the westside - highway
Doing what we like to do - our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

[Chorus:]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus]

[Beyonce]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfried,
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend


"Work It Out"

How you doing honey baby
You know I don't ask for much but
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough
But I hear a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

[Chorus:]
Is y'all alright 
I don't know but I know what's happening to me girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now

See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

Child, blow your horn now
Come on, Child, blow your horn now

So we shakin back and forth now
Just keep it coming babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You got to, you got to keep on strumming babe
But in the back of my mind
I wonder is it gonna be the last time
We if there ain't nobody loving and you goin keep it coming
Well baby with me that's fine

[Chorus]

I like this!
Uh, look it here...BRIDGE!

So baby hold me 
Like you don't wanna let go
I'm feeling foxy
Cause boy you working it out
Daddy you given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole bee hive
I'm gonna call you my sugar 
Cause I (I) had the sweetest time
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

I like it when the horn go [x4]

Ha! Austin better work it out
Ha! Foxy better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out

"Daddy"

I remember when you used to take
Me on a bike ride everyday
On the bayou
You remember that? We were inseparable

And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work
And I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so excited
I was so happy to see you
So happy to see you

Because you love me I overcome
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you've protected me
I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date
And had a boyfriend
My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face

I still remember I called you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could've said, "Beyoncé, I told you so."
Instead you said you'd get one too
You and my mama said y'all get one just like mine

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you've protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory that's why…

My unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away

I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop the tears from falling
I love you so much, daddy

Thank you
You've done so much for me
I love you, daddy

I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy
